                    A: The project was broken down into several key phases:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Choosing the API and testing endpoints with Postman.</li>

                    A: Tasks were distributed based on individual strengths and expertise:
                    <ul>
                        <li>One team member focused on API integration and backend logic.</li>
                        <li>Another handled frontend design and user interface development.</li>
                        <li>A third member was responsible for testing and documentation.</li>
                    </ul>
